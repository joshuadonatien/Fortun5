# Fortun5

Hi we are Fortun5 our project (name to be deteremined) sets out to solve the problem negative mental health within the prison system. As we all know mass incarceration disproportionately effects people of color within the United States. They are put into the prison system with the promise of reformation only to come out even more negatively impacted by the experiences of prison. Our product hopes to solve this problem by checking up on the mental health of people within the prison system and giving them a positive outlet in the way of creativity.

The Tone analysis code takes questions regarding the mental heaalth of the prisoner from the questions.txt file and recieves a response from the user. Once the code has gotten the response it checks for keywords in the response to gauge the tone of the writers mood. It then returns whether it was positive or negative and rea list of the tone of the writing after the user has finished responding to all the question. The data is the pushed to a plot to see the trends in the users mood.

The journal is a little notepad that allows for the user to journal their thoughts. The user is able to create poems and short stories within the notepad. If after the user is done with the file they can save it and open a new file. It also allows users to open old files and continue past work.

The White board allows for users to express themselves creatively through digital art. The user is able to pick through different colors and brush sizes to create there art freely.
