# Fortun5

Hi we are Fortun5 our project (name to be deteremined) sets out to solve the problem negative mental health within the prison system. As we all know mass incarceration disproportionately effects people of color within the United States. They are put into the prison system with the promise of reformation only to come out even more negatively impacted by the experiences of prison. Our product hopes to solve this problem by checking up on the mental health of people within the prison system and giving them a positive outlet in the way of creativity.
